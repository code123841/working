        Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (About this soundlisten) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (About this soundlisten)
        wik-ee-) is a multilingual open-collaborative online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of
        volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system. It is one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by
        Alexa, as of August 2020.[3] Featuring no advertisements, it is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American
        non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.

        Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Sanger coined its name[4][5] as a
        portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia". It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in
        other languages were quickly developed. With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the
        more than 300 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles[6] attracting
        1.7 billion unique visitors per month.[7][8]

        Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias,
        with the majority of editors being male. Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase
        the coverage of women's topics.[9] In 2006 Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to
        edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the
        vision of Jimmy Wales.[10] The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to
        improve its quality and reliability. In 2018 Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect
        fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles.[11]</p>
